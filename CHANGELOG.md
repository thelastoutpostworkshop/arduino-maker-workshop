# Change Log

All notable changes to the Arduino Malker Workshop extension will be documented in this file.

**Version 1.0.6**
- Reduced Arduino CLI cache durations so board metadata refreshes hourly and library info every 30 minutes, balancing freshness with CLI call volume ([issue #68](https://github.com/thelastoutpostworkshop/arduino-maker-workshop/issues/68))
- Trim additional board URLs before saving and simplify the add/edit dialog validation
- Optimized packaging by excluding unused node_modules while preserving USB runtime support
- Notify when a zip library installation is completed
- Detect build profile value changes and invalidate the previous build output so the next compile reflects the new configuration
- Render Arduino CLI output with color in a dedicated panel view during compilation
- Highlight compile warnings/errors inline in the colorized CLI output panel  ([issue #69](https://github.com/thelastoutpostworkshop/arduino-maker-workshop/issues/69))
- Consolidated compile/upload logs into the colorized panel and removed the legacy output channel
